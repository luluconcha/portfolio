From the user's standpoint, apart from the About page, it was quite obscure; they just clicked on a \"magic\" (actually social policies, housing issues or climate change), then on a crystal ball, and after an 8 seconds animation were told they had sent an email after the fact. In the back end, I was scraping through puppeteer publicly available data from the Congreso de Diputados and Senado websites, which I stored in MySQL. I tied this with official party news site or the closest thing I could find, if that didn't exist. I was then sending this info (chosen magic, politician's name, and webpage) to the OpenAI API, asking it to parse the page and compose a message to figure out what was missing, or what they could do better. That message was then sent to the politician through nodemailer, from a email address made for the purpose of this project.",

Given the 4 days deadline for this project, I did not get around to tying the characters to the storypoints --but for the last 3-week group project, we decided to create a full-fleshed, actually playable version of this.",
